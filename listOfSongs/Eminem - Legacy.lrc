[length: 04:56]
[00:00.97]Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
[00:03.59]I'll be right there for you
[00:06.31]Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
[00:09.40]I'll say it all for you
[00:13.52]I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
[00:18.19]Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
[00:20.96]What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
[00:23.82]Because I don't belong in this world
[00:25.63]That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
[00:28.65]Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
[00:31.30]So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
[00:35.21]And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
[00:38.14]Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
[00:41.00]Thinking he can try and solve them
[00:42.74]I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
[00:45.62]And in the front drive talking to myself
[00:48.07]Either that or inside hidin' off in the corner somewhere quiet
[00:52.11]Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
[00:55.43]I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
[00:57.42]Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
[01:00.13]And he said that I eyeballed him
[01:01.91]And if you fall, I'll get you there
[01:07.64]I'll be your savior from
[01:11.98]All the wars that are fought
[01:15.01]Inside your world
[01:18.08]Please have faith in my words
[01:21.79]'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
[01:29.75]This is my legacy, legacy, air
[01:35.44]There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
[01:41.09]This is my legacy, legacy
[01:44.74]Legacy, legacy
[01:47.51]I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
[01:51.39]Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
[01:54.45]'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
[01:57.32]'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
[02:00.32]Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
[02:03.74]But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
[02:06.28]There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
[02:09.45]Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
[02:12.08]I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
[02:15.24]Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
[02:18.04]Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
[02:20.89]Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
[02:24.09]But if this is all there is for me life offers
[02:26.75]Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
[02:29.65]But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
[02:32.81]What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
[02:34.73]They are kinda giving me confidence
[02:36.36]Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
[02:38.45]Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
[02:41.45]To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
[02:44.40]Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
[02:47.26]Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
[02:50.20]Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
[02:53.19]I could be iconic, and my conquest is
[02:55.96]Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest
[02:58.28]This is my legacy, legacy, air
[03:03.27]This is my legacy, legacy, air
[03:09.12]There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
[03:14.92]This is my legacy, legacy
[03:18.77]Legacy, legacy
[03:21.36]I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
[03:25.34]Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
[03:28.46]'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
[03:31.01]Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
[03:33.86]And use my enemy's words as strength
[03:35.98]To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
[03:38.66]'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
[03:41.55]By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
[03:44.33]Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
[03:47.24]Thought I was full of horseshit and now
[03:49.40]You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
[03:51.58]Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
[03:54.54]Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
[03:57.49]So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
[04:00.63]It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
[04:03.68]'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
[04:06.31]You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
[04:09.36]With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
[04:12.25]You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
[04:15.26]Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
[04:18.32]And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
[04:20.95]The most high exalting and I ain't halting
[04:24.23]Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
[04:26.82]The best part about me is I am not you
[04:29.94]I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my
[04:32.40]Legacy, legacy, air
[04:37.00]This is my legacy, legacy, air
[04:43.01]There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
[04:48.32]This is my legacy, legacy
[04:52.33]Legacy, legacy
[04:54.04]
