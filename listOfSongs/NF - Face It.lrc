[01:10.28]Devil in my ear tryna tell me everything's great
[01:13.85]And in a year I'll realize I'm in the same place
[01:17.59]Running in the same race, same pace

[01:56.79]Sin is bittersweet I taste it, bittersweet I taste it
[02:00.23]Get that sickness out my mouth
[02:02.05]I feel like my train is derailing
[02:04.14]I can feel it
