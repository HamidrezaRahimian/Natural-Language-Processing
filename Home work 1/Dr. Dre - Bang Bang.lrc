[00:42.84]Than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
[00:45.47]Niggas spray strays and shoot without lookin'
[00:47.65]Niggas walk by and blast without leavin' a footprint
[00:50.39]I think the attitudes are twice as worst
[00:52.58]It takes half the time to get your life reversed

[01:20.57]Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
[01:23.27]Murder arrives, anytime
[01:24.64]Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
[01:26.67]Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
[01:29.87]With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
[01:32.28]Bustin' on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
[01:35.43]These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
[01:38.53]Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
[01:40.88]On every corner, Cali niggas are dumpin'
[01:43.16]You'll be shakin' your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
[01:45.62]Makin' death not so foreign to ya
[01:47.47]Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough
[01:49.42]Ammo to leave an armored truck Swiss cheese
[01:51.36]I've learned to stay away from house parties
[01:53.00]I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin'
[01:55.67]Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
[01:58.83]Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

[02:25.44]Can't even stand, in front of your buildin' and chill without yieldin'
[02:29.19]12 year old children that kill, blood spillin'
[02:31.69]Thugs be illin', unnecessary slugs fillin' the sky
[02:34.39]Usually drillin' the one that wasn't willin' to die
[02:36.97]Yes, sir in the Killing Field I got my, life preserver
[02:40.36]And I'll do my time for murder, these niggas got the nerve to

[02:47.94]'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
[02:49.82]A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on
[02:52.47]Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hitlist
[02:55.78]Peep this, I cock back, you bow down
