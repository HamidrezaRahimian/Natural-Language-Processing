[01:13.98]Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (what all the niggas sayin'?)
[01:19.13]Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (hell yeah)
[01:24.32]Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride
[01:32.15]Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre, so I'll begin like this
[01:35.76]No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
[01:37.98]It's just that gangsta glare with gangsta raps
[01:41.19]That gangsta shit makes a gangs of snaps, uh
[01:44.08]Word to the motherfuckin' streets
[01:46.33]And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
[01:49.03]That I hit you with, that I get you with
[01:51.49]As I groove in my four on D's, hittin' the switches
[01:54.49]Bitches, relax, while I get my proper swerve on
[01:56.90]Bumpin' like a motherfucker, ready to get my serve on
[01:59.81]But before I hit the dope spot
[02:01.96]Gotta get the chronic, the RÃ©my Martin and my soda pop
[02:04.94]Now I'm smellin' like Indonesia

[03:04.64]Tryin' to set me up for a two-eleven
[03:06.99]Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
[03:09.76]But I don't represent no gangbang
[03:11.64]Some niggas like lynchin', but I just watch 'em hang
[03:14.18]So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on?
[03:16.88]I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
[03:20.46]Didn't nobody wanna speak
[03:21.97]Now everybody peepin' out they window
[03:23.76]When they hear me beatin' up the street
[03:25.66]Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
[03:27.67]That's what they say every single motherfuckin' day
[03:30.43]Yo, but I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it
[03:32.79]While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin' I'll be-
