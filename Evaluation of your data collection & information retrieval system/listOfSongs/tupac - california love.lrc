[00:44.18]Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
[00:47.29]A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
[00:49.51]The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
[00:52.11]Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
[00:54.83]We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be

[02:21.34]Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
[02:23.92]Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
[02:27.29]Where cowards die and the strong ball
[02:29.25]Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
[02:32.03]In LA, we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
[02:34.63]Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
[02:37.44]Flossin' but have caution, we collide with other crews
[02:40.09]Famous because we throw grams
[02:41.75]Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
[02:44.98]Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
[02:46.84]It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
[02:50.24]Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
[02:52.89]Let me serenade the streets of LA
[02:55.19]From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
