[00:05.87]The watered down one, the one you know
[00:08.92]Was made up centuries ago
[00:11.73]They made it sound all wack and corny
[00:14.54]Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
[00:17.43]Twisted fictions, sick addiction

[01:20.51]Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
[01:23.43]That's me, the first year that I blow
[01:26.10]How you say broke in Spanish? Me, no hablo
[01:29.12]Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
[01:31.63]Me found bravery in my bravado
[01:34.54]DJs need to listen to the models
[01:37.14]"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
[01:39.61](You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
[01:40.76]Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
[01:42.88]I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
[01:45.46]And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
[01:48.19]So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[02:07.78]Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
[02:10.27]Tell me, how do you respond to students?
[02:12.45]And refresh the page and restart the memory?
[02:15.06]Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
[02:17.96]We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
[02:20.65]Sorry for the night demons still visit me
[02:23.80]The plan was to drink until the pain over
[02:26.46]But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
[02:29.21]Fresh air, rollin' down the window
[02:31.87]Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
[02:34.83]Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
[02:37.69]Don't make me pull the toys

[02:59.81]Just kids, no parents
[03:02.57]Then the sky filled with herons
[03:03.92](I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
[03:07.99]And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
[03:10.83]And the fires did declare us
[03:12.52]But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
