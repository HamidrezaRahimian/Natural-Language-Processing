[00:58.54]
[00:58.97]Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
[01:01.14]
[01:01.36]Protectors and be sure that you stand close

[01:04.07]Watch each others backs and guard your command post
[01:06.03]
[01:06.36]And most of all be advised that he's wise
[01:08.87]
[01:09.20]He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
[01:11.15]

[01:21.52]Verse 3:
[01:21.73]I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
[01:23.58]To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
[01:26.30]For what he first did to me
[01:27.60]It's sure to be the last
[01:28.90]Following footprints with a magnifying glass
[01:31.51]To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
[01:34.01]I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
[01:36.51]I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
[01:38.89]"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"

[01:51.59]
[01:52.04]Verse 4:
[01:52.15]I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
[01:54.43]Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
[01:56.93]Inside the depths of his basement
[01:58.99]I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place… went!
[02:02.57]I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
[02:04.65]I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
[02:07.14]None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
[02:09.87]Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
[02:12.26]
[02:12.48]Chorus: [sampled from Eminem's Fucking Backstabber chorus sung by Proof]
[02:13.23]C'mere you fucking backstabber

[02:20.99]Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[02:22.29]
[02:22.61]Verse 5:
[02:23.05]Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
[02:25.00]They're only powerful when you got your back turned
[02:27.51]I yearned for the day that we finally met again
[02:30.22]So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
[02:32.73]He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
[02:35.22]I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
[02:37.72]Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
[02:40.33]Beating him over the head with the telephone
[02:42.83]
[02:43.05]Police voice:
[02:43.19]Attention all cars, attention all cars
[02:45.15]Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
[02:47.77]He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
[02:50.43]He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?
[02:53.48]
[02:54.04]Chorus: [sampled from Eminem's Fucking Backstabber chorus sung by Proof]
[02:54.13]C'mere you fucking backstabber
