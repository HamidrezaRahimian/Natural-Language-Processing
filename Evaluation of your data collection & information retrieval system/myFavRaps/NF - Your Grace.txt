[length: 03:40]
[00:04.86]YeahYeah
[00:06.82]Sometimes I feel like
[00:07.87](Feeling like I lost my mind)
[00:09.13]I'm as close as I've ever been to you
[00:10.86]And then the next moment
[00:12.80](You are not a waste of time)
[00:15.27]It's like I'm running from you
[00:15.93]And I'm sorry
[00:17.66]This is not how it's supposed to be
[00:20.16]But sometimes that's how it happens
[00:26.01]Forgive me
[00:27.29]Yeah
[00:28.53]I feel lost in my mind
[00:34.02]Just another pain in my head
[00:35.77]I feel so broken inside
[00:39.92]With memories I'm tryna forget
[00:41.93]I don't feel like I used to
[00:47.04]Matter 'a fact not even close
[00:49.53]I don't feel right
[00:51.29]Yet I choose to
[00:53.69]To go to a place I don't know
[00:55.99]Maybe I'm crazy
[00:57.86]Maybe I'm not
[01:00.86]But I feel like I'm outta control
[01:02.23]And God, I need you
[01:06.04]Right now
[01:07.34]I never should've let you go
[01:13.62]Now I'm just so out of control
[01:21.78]And now I don't know who I am
[01:24.98]This was never my plan
[01:28.20]This ain't how it's supposed to be
[01:30.24]I took it out of your hands
[01:31.90]I took a chance
[01:35.07]But how am I supposed to see
[01:37.66]When I'm blinded
[01:39.37]And when I'm broken
[01:41.97]Lookin' for a way to escape
[01:44.13]I can't find it
[01:46.10]But then I'm reminded of your grace
[01:50.03](Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:56.10]Of your grace
[01:57.62](Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:01.13]I thought I was fine
[02:06.64]I guess not
[02:09.24]If I was I wouldn't feel this way
[02:11.81]If I was okay
[02:13.47]And I was so perfect
[02:16.18]Then why do I feel so ashamed
[02:18.76]I'm no liar in my head
[02:22.99]Screaming I don't need any help
[02:25.57]I say I'm tryin', yet in the end
[02:29.46]I'm only tellin' lies to myself
[02:32.38]I say I want answers
[02:34.34]Complaining
[02:36.72]Yeah, I'm just looking for truth
[02:38.92]Unless I got problems
[02:41.08]Which I got 'em
[02:45.67]I seem I only blame 'em on you, whoa
[02:50.14]It's like I don't know what to do, whoa, yeah
[02:58.26]And now I don't know who I am
[03:00.85]This was never my plan

[03:48.57]Look in the mirror but I don't see me
