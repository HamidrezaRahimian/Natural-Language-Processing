[00:54.83]But
[00:55.50]Be careful what you wish for!
[00:58.36]I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
[01:00.39]They call me Slim Roethlisberger
[01:02.27]I go berzerker than a fed up post office worker
[01:05.00]A merk her with a Mossberg
[01:06.54]I'm pissed off get murdered
[01:08.01]Like someone took a ketchup squirter
[01:09.61]Squirted a frankfurter
[01:10.79]For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
[01:13.11]When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
[01:14.82]Like a terrible towel
[01:16.20]How thangs turn around
[01:17.33]When his fangs come out
[01:18.35]Get your brains blown out
[01:19.40]That's what I call blowing your mind
[01:20.92]When I come back

[01:33.99]He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
[01:36.55]And nobody fucks with him
[01:37.94]Rigor mortis and post mortem
[01:39.44]He's dying of boredom
[01:40.74]Take your best rhymes, record 'em
[01:42.24]Then try to thwart him
[01:43.48]He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
[01:44.94]Shit stained drawers
[01:46.11]You gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
[01:48.57]While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
[01:50.82]Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
[01:53.62]You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
[01:56.64]I'm almost famous!
[01:57.86]You dream of trading places
[02:00.07]Oh-oh, I have been changing faces

[02:20.50]But
[02:21.26]Be careful of what you wish for!
[02:24.43]I'm back for revenge
[02:26.17]I lost a battle that ain't happening again
[02:28.02]I'm at your throat like strep
[02:29.75]I step, strapped with a pen
[02:31.25]Metaphors wrote on my hand
[02:32.68]Some are just stored in my memory
[02:34.07]Some I wrote on a napkin
[02:35.66]I do what I have to to win
[02:36.97]Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
[02:39.56]Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers?
[02:42.52]And tell that psycho to pass the torch
[02:44.41]To the wacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
[02:47.05]And smash it on his porch
[02:48.44]Now get off my dick
[02:49.48]Dick's too short of a word for my dick
[02:51.15]Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
[02:53.99]Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
[02:56.82]I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
[02:59.68]I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
[03:02.53]Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner
[03:04.88]Like Verne Troyer
[03:05.85]Y'all are Eminem backwards, you're Mini Me's
[03:08.03]See he's in a whole nother weight class
[03:10.07]He's slugs; you're BBs, you're bean-bag bullets
[03:12.07]You're full of it; you were dissing in his CD's
[03:14.05]Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
[03:16.76]No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
[03:19.06]His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E.
[03:22.35]He's almost famous!
[03:23.86]You dream of trading places
[03:25.92]Oh-oh, I have been changing faces
[03:28.69]Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
[03:31.43]Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
[03:34.05]Oh-oh-oh-oh, wake up behind these trenches
[03:37.14]Oh-oh, you run around defenceless
[03:39.98]Oh-oh, there is too much to lose
[03:42.83]Oh-oh, you cannot fill these shoes
[03:45.22]I just wanna be famous
[03:46.44]But
[03:47.10]Be careful of what you wish for!
[03:50.28]Now there he goes in Dre's studio cupping his balls
[03:53.97]Screaming the wood off the paneling
[03:55.62]And cussing the paint off the walls
[03:57.03]Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
[03:59.62]He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
[04:02.31]He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
[04:05.59]With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "Aah!"
[04:08.21]These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
[04:11.03]If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
[04:13.97]They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
[04:16.95]Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
[04:19.72]And eat shit while they at it
[04:21.32]He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
[04:23.38]So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
[04:25.59]The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
[04:28.30]Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
[04:31.23]Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
[04:34.27]Who could've known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
[04:36.96]And while I'm being poetic let me get it stoic and raise the bar
[04:40.09]Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
[04:42.82]So bear witness to some biblical shit
[04:44.88]There's a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
[04:47.48]He did it
[04:48.16]He made it
[04:48.83]He's finally famous!
[04:49.78]
