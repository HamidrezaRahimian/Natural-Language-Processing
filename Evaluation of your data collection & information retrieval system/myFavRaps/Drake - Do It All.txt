[00:58.82]I be getting money so long
[01:00.62]Its just paper to me
[01:02.12]Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
[01:05.48]You can never reminisce when you forget it all
[01:08.70]Careful what you wish for, you might just get it all
[01:12.00]Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio
[01:14.67]Baby forget about it
[01:16.09]Im headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed
[01:19.63]You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
[01:22.99]My judgements never clouded
[01:24.54]That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
[01:27.95]I’m about whatever man

[02:30.50]Where’d I just put my bow tie
[02:32.05]Millionnaire multi
[02:33.79]Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
[02:37.91]Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
[02:41.01]I’m the man now, I guess thta parts a given
[02:44.40]So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
[02:47.63]I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
[02:51.23]I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
[02:54.31]Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
[02:57.66]And me falling and landing in love shouldnt happen
[03:00.71]Becuase everythings easier to get into than get out off
[03:04.62]But someone show me to the owner of this city
[03:07.41]Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
[03:11.57]I’m still the mafia, still run the commitee
[03:14.61]NY forever n-gga, Diddy,
